# Password Generator

In this week's project a Password Generator was created. The criteria was for the length to be between 8 characters long and 128. The user will be asked a series of prompts on whether they want certain characters in their password(e.g. lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters). Once every question is answered the input will be validated and at least one character typed should be selected. Once the user completes the process a password will be generated based on the user's selection. Once the password is generated it will display on the screed of the application.

## Purpose
